I thought last week was the hardest but this challenge really got me. It's clear bootstrap and jQuery are a lot to process and I definitely need more time to grasp them. Tutoring and sleepless nights managed to help me produce this rough final product. It's not perfect and I need more knowledge and experience to use these skills in the future, but for now, I survived. Here's to another week.
